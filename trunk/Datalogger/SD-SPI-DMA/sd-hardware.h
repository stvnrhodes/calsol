 * Revision History
 * Date			Author	Change
 * 18 Jul 2011	Ducky	Initial interface definition.
 * 21 Jul 2011	Ducky	Added some more functions, removed the "write-back"
 *						returns in favor of doing command-specific get result
 *						functions.
 *
 * @file
 * Hardware abstraction interface function prototypes and defines.
 * 
 * The current architecture has the infastructure to support multiple cards
 * per microcontroller (which is why the SD_Card structure is included
 * in every argument list), but currently that functionality is not
 * implemented in the hardware-dependent layer because of performance reasons
 * and lack of necessity.
