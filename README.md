This repository formerly lived at https://code.google.com/p/calsol/. It
was moved to github after news of Google Code's closure.

The design for Impulse, CalSol's 7th car, was started in Fall 2009. It raced
in two races, the 2011 [World Solar Challenge](http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/)
and the 2012 [American Solar Challenge](http://americansolarchallenge.org/). A
small amount of maintainance happened afterwards to keep the car in driving
state for several years, but the code has remained basically unchanged.

Each microcontroller in the car has its own folder. Most controllers used the
[BRAIN](https://github.com/CalSol/BRAIN) inset into a custom board.
